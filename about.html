  <h3 style="backdrop-filter: blur(25px); padding: 5px; border-radius: 25px">Hello, I am Umut Eren Dogru.</h3>
  <p style="backdrop-filter: blur(25px); padding: 15px; border-radius: 25px;">
  I am currently a 19 y.o Sophomore Electrical Engineering B.Eng. student at Yildiz Technical University with currently
  2.9 GPA out of 4.00.
  <p style="backdrop-filter: blur(25px); padding: 15px; border-radius: 25px;"> I am the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, also one of the founder members at YTU Debate Society.
  I am active members in different student societies such as IEEE YTU Student Branch and YTU SKYLAB (Computer Sciences Society).</p>
  <p style="backdrop-filter: blur(25px); padding: 15px; border-radius: 25px;"> I have taken part of different student events as team members such as; Astronomy Days event which took part in March '22 and was organized by YTU Astronomy Society and Society Presidents Debate Tournament which took part in December '22 and was organized by YTU Debate Society.</p>
  <p style="backdrop-filter: blur(25px); padding: 15px; border-radius: 25px;"> I have taken part in total of 3 different national debate tournaments and debated on different world topics such as economy, diplomacy, politics and many more. I have lead the Debate Team and the Student Club also in my high school. And I have taken part in a Model UN event in my middle school, which was named TanMUN'16. </p>
  <p style="backdrop-filter: blur(25px); padding: 15px; border-radius: 25px;"> I have attended different classes organized by the IEEE Branch and the SKYLAB Society from which I have acquired different technical skills such as Solidworks, Altium, Python, HTML/CSS/JS, Arduino. Also, I have learned AutoCad and C programming language from the classes I take. </p>
  <p style="backdrop-filter: blur(25px); padding: 15px; border-radius: 25px;"> My hobbies are reading books, coding, listening to music and trying to learn new languages. I have been reading "Dune" by Frank Herbert lately, because I have seen the recently made version of the Dune movie by Dennis Villeneuve and I loved it and the Dune universe, so I wanted to read the books. I am on the 200th page currently and I love it very much.
    I have been studying German lately on different kinds of resources, one being the most popular language learning mobile app called "Duolingo". I have been also checking Deutsche Welle's German teaching website. Ich kann Deutsch sprachen aber Ich bin nicht sehr gut. Ich studiere jeden Tag und kann verstehen ein paar Worte für jetzt.
    (EN: I can speak German, but I'm not very good. I am studying every day and understand a few words and phrases for now.) I have been working on this website recently as a side hobby project. I want to proceed on different projects with the languages C and Python after I am done with this website.</p>
